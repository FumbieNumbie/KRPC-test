To do:
Move burn decider from physics.cs to Radar.cs if possible.
Move slope method to radar.cs.
Длина траектроии: интеграл от a до b sqrt(1+2y*y)dx

Use impact position prediction to measure slope and decide if the spot is landable.
Check if there is a better spot closer or further from the original prediction.
